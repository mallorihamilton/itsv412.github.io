</div></p>
<p>Pumpkin based foods such as pumpkin bread have been around for many years. Archealogists have even found remnants of these foods from as long as 800 years ago in the SouthWestern United States!</p>
<p>These foods were used by the Native Americans as a sign of celebration for a successful harvest and were then passed along/ adopted by the European settlers. Each tribe of Natives had their own recipes prior to the Europeans arrival.</p>
<p>The first recipe that was published for pumpkin bread came in the form of Lettice Bryan's 1839 cookbook, "The Kentucky Housewife."</p>
