<H2> Wondering how to make this fantastic pumpkin bread? </H2>
<H1> You came to the right place!</H1>
<p> 1) Adjust the oven rack to the lower third position and preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). 
Lowering the oven rack prevents the top of your bread from browning too much, too soon. Grease a metal 9×5-inch loaf pan with non-stick spray.
Set aside.</p>
<p> 2)In a large bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, ginger, and salt together until combined. 
Set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs, granulated sugar, and brown sugar together until combined. Whisk in the pumpkin, oil, and orange juice. 
Pour these wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and gently mix together using a rubber spatula or a wooden spoon. There will be a few lumps. 
Do not over-mix. Gently fold in the chocolate chips, if including. </p>
<p> 3)Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Bake for 60–65 minutes, making sure to loosely cover the bread with aluminum foil halfway through to 
prevent the top from getting too brown.  The bread is done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean with only a few small moist crumbs. 
This may be before or after 60–65 minutes depending on your oven, so begin checking every 5 minutes around the 55-minute mark. </p>
<p> 4)Allow the bread to cool completely in the pan on a wire rack before removing and slicing.</p>
<p> 5)Cover and store leftover pumpkin bread at room temperature for up to 3–4 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week.</p>
<p><H1> ENJOY!</H></p>
